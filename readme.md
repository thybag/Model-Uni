# Model Uni
### An open source university simulation game.

Model-uni is an isometric University simulation game. Found your own university, build the campus, hire the staff and set the courses. Then attempt to make a profit without the staff revolting over lack of car parking and the students sleeping through all their classes.

**Warning** This project is still in very early pre-alpha development and is highly unstable. Much of the codebase is incomplete and sparsely commented. I am currently only regularly testing in chrome.

Live demo: http://userbag.co.uk/labs/modeluni/

Model-Uni is written in JavaScript and is built using a vareity of open source packages:

* Sprite.js - https://github.com/batiste/sprite.js
* Require.js - http://requirejs.org/
* Bootstrap - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap
* store.js - https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js
* Tile set from: Kenney.nl via http://opengameart.org/content/isometric-road-tiles-nova (CC-BY 3)

## Quickstart guide

1. Clone the "Model-Uni" repo in to a directory on your webserver
2. Point your browser at the directory
3. Done!

## Want to help?

Given my limited game making experience, taking on a project the size I suspect model-uni will be, on my own, is a bit of a crazy prospect. 

If youâ€™re interested in simulation games, have some spare time and either a working knowledge of JavaScript or the ability to create quality isometric graphics, please get in touch.

Even if you just have some ideas you'd like to suggest, feel free to raise them as feature request in the issues section.
